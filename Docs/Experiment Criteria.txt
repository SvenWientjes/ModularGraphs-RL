1. Qualitatively different transition types should place diffent demands on behaviour under optimal conditions
	* Modularity should bias people away from this behaviour
		- But provide a cognitively 'cheap' heuristic for still pretty good behaviour
		- E.g. transitioning into the wrong bottleneck with 7 steps left might still have positive EV but pp still terminate
2. Even when participants fail pretty badly - say they never terminate - overall EV should be slightly positive
	* Participants should walk away with some bonus money
3. The difference in obtained value between optimal behaviour and bad behaviour (e.g. never terminate) should be large
	* Ideally no overlap in distribution
4. A decently high rate of getting to the reward for every separate miniblock
	* Include multiple rewards?
